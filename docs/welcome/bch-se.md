### Boost your StackExchange reputation!

> Based on the terrific recommendations of __[Mark](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/a/30047)__ and __[Rosco Kalis](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/a/30048).__

Instead of trying to attract established users, __try to develop them.__

People get __2 reputation__ for each edit they suggest that gets accepted. These edits can be really small _(code formatting, highlighting, grammar, spelling)._ By going through the __"new questions"__ queue in a single StackExchange site and applying small but valuable edits, __it's possible to gain much reputation quickly.__

### Here is a list of TOP candidates _(already committed to the initiative)_ to support getting to that 200 reputation mark:
