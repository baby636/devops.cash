# Foreword

> __Disclaimer:__ This is the opinion of Shomari Prince (nyusternie) and __DOES NOT__ represent the view of the greater BCH Please Foundation.

The Bitcoin Cash community needs BUIDLers to attract and keep the users it so desperately wants to __grow its utility to every man, woman and child across the world.__

> __"If you BUIDL it, they will come" .. Ain't gonna cut it!__  
_Even when they DO come; who says they will stay? and SPEDN?_

### BUIDLers need to be organized

Telgram and Slack are great for real-time communications. However, they don't have as much value when it comes to the __wide spread of "Knowledge"__ throughout the community.
