This document is designed specifically for developers; and it will be __presumed that you will be running on "some" flavor if Linux__ when operating BCHN _(either in production or for testing purposes)._

## Building a BCH Node

It is always recommended to build from source. This guide will "hopefully" take some of that pain away.

### Linux

__Debian 10 is currently the recommended OS for building BCHN.__

However, these instructions can be easily modified for Debian 8+; as well as other popular distributions:

- [ ✓ ] Debian 8+
- [ 𐄂 ] Ubuntu 16.04+
- [ 𐄂 ] RedHat / Fedora / CentOS
